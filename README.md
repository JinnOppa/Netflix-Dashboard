# Netflix Data Analysis Dashboard

This project is my individual endeavor to analyze Netflix data using a Power BI dashboard. The dashboard provides visualizations and valuable insights into various aspects of Netflix, including content distribution, user demographics, ratings, genres, directors, and more.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to explore and gain a deep understanding of the Netflix dataset retrieved from Kaggle. It's important to note that the dataset has not undergone any cleaning or preprocessing. Instead, I have directly visualized the raw data using Power BI, allowing users to explore and analyze Netflix's content library, user base, and trends in its unprocessed form.

## Dataset

The Netflix dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle. You can access the dataset using the following link:

[Netflix Shows Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

Before importing the dataset into Power BI, please perform data cleaning and pre-processing to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.

# Netflix Data Analysis Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing Netflix data through a Power BI dashboard. The dashboard provides visualizations and insights into various aspects of Netflix, including content distribution, user demographics, ratings, genres, directors, and more.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to explore and understand the Netflix dataset obtained from Kaggle. Through data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization techniques, we have developed an interactive and informative Power BI dashboard that allows users to gain valuable insights into Netflix's content library, user base, and trends.

## Dataset
The Netflix dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle. You can access the dataset using the following link:
